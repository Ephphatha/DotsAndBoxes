Originally written as an assignment for my Win32 class ITC226, this is a
somewhat featureful implementation of the pen and paper game "Dots and Boxes".

Features:
  Supports game boards up to 50x50 dots in size
  Effectively unlimited player count
  Custom colours for each player
  Basic AI (add a player with "[AI]" in their name)
  Able to save/load player lists and game state
  Dynamic resizing of game board
